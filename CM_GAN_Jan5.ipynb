        "#### Input:\n",
        "- An **image** with missing regions (masked image).\n",
        "- A **binary mask** representing the missing areas (1 for missing, 0 for existing pixels).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Layers:\n",
        "1. **Convolutional Layers with Mask Concatenation**:\n",
        "   - Initial layers concatenate the image with the binary mask.\n",
        "   - Convolutions extract features from the masked regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Purpose**: Learn the structure and surrounding context of the image.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Cascaded Modulation Block**:\n",
        "   - Combines **global modulation** (to understand overall image semantics) with **spatially adaptive modulation** (to handle local details).\n",
        "   - Global modulation uses a feature map that spans the entire image.\n",
        "   - Adaptive modulation applies location-specific adjustments.\n",
