# Image Inpaint Repository

Welcome to the **Image Inpaint** repository! This repository is dedicated to image inpainting techniques and experiments using various machine learning models, including U-Net, xLSTM, and GAN-based methods.

## Features
- Implementation of multiple image inpainting architectures.
- Comprehensive experiments and evaluations.
- Jupyter notebooks for easy experimentation and customization.

## Repository Structure
- `/notebooks/`: Contains experimental Jupyter notebooks for different inpainting models.
- `/data/`: Example datasets for training and testing.
- `/models/`: Saved model architectures and weights.
- `/utils/`: Helper preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation scripts.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## Models
1. **U-Net**: A baseline architecture for inpainting.
2. **xLSTM**: Enhanced temporal models for sequential inpainting.
3. **GANs**: Generative adversarial networks for high-quality results.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fjadidi2001/Image_Inpaint.git
   ```

## Contributions
Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the repository. Contributions are welcome!
